      <p>Reeling from the untimely assissnation of Olarian Grand Cleric Delseris Patia, the party heads to 4533 Jester
        Street, an address written a piece of paper belonging to the assassin. There, they find Ries Florence, a man
        Khairo speaks to under the guise of being the assassin. Florence hands them the address to a man named Othar
        Fusestride for another assignment, as well as a potential buyer of their elemental gem. Unsure of how to
        proceed,
        the party turn their attention towards earning coin, winning some silver from a few rounds of cards. The next
        day,
        they pick up a job from the tavern, attending to an estate's rat infestation for 40 gold. Feeling better
        prepared
        after a round of shopping, the four head into the wealthier neighborhoods of Soshuva. Mark, using the letter
        provided by Florence and disguised as the assassin, enters the gated community with an invisible Khairo. Shimyra
        and Wohn, unable to find easy entrance, remain outside the gates. Bells ring around the city as Delseris Patia's
        death is announced. 3 more days until the wedding.</p>

      <p>----</p>

      <h3>Everything Before</h3>
      <p>Our party of novice adventurers are startled to find themsevles waking up in a dark, musty cottage. An old
        woman,
        who introduces herself as Egres, informs them that she knocked out a poisoned them to coerice the group into
        completing a job for her. She tells them to break into a nearby Lord Adamine's manor and steal the Eye of
        Biesis,
        as well as a vial of Mitune's Grief, a rare ingredient necessary for the posion's antidote.The poison is slow
        acting, with irrevirsible effects after 24 hours. As such, the party is given until sunrise the next morning to
        complete her task and return to the cottage.</p>
      <p>Heading into the town of Shommsend, the party learn from the local apothecary that Lord Adamine may be ill with
        some strange illness and hasn't been spotted in a few days. Hitching a ride with a caravan of cabbages, the
        group reaches the manor where they meet Maise, a serving maid concerned for her lord's health, and Leo the
        manor's personal apothecary's apprentice. Masie sneaks the party up to Lord Adamine's quarter, where Khairo
        detects necromantic magic centered around Adamine himself. Searching the apothecary, Shimyra discovers a hidden
        door leading to a dark dungeon. There, the party discovers Leo conducting an infernal ritual. While the party
        does manage to kill Leo, they fail to do so before the ritual completes, with Leo's final words being “the world
        is waking. He will find him. He will find…”. In a secret storage room, the party find the Eye of Biesis, as well
        as a vial of Mitune's Tear on Leo's person. Lord Adamine awakes from his coma and thanks the party with a feast.
        However, the party doesn't stay long, rushing back to Egres's cottage with their stolen artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>Satisfied with their success, Egres brews the antidotes and allows the party to stay for the night. After
        tracing, Shimyra speaks with Egres in the kitchen, learning that she used to be a cleric of Olar. Egres responds
        strangely to Shymira's questions regarding the Eye of Biesis. As the sunrises, the cottage around the party
        disintegrates into the light, leaving them layingin the dirt. Egres disappears along with it.</p>
      <p>
        The party heads back into Shommsend and join a Goldensword Company caravan as guards, replacing three
        mercenaries
        who had disappeared. Along the way to Soshuva, a
        horde of goblins attack. Fending them off, Mark find a letter in one of the stole bags, written by a "C" to "CH"
        (see Items).
        The next evening, a day before reaching Soshuva, three undead (the three missing mercenaries) burst out of
        caravan
        carts and attack the party. From the trees, a strange tiefling named Branch helps the party defeat their undead
        attackers. Only a few hours away from the city, the caravan agrees to let Branch come with them. Having bonded
        with the party, especially with Shymira, Branch enslists the group to help her find the Olaran Conclave, one of
        the only things she remembers ever since she awoke a month ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the party enters into Soshuva, the entire city is preparing for a wedding between Azamier Rathon Fusestride,
        the first son of the most prominent Blessed Family of Opalaris, to Agnes Sternwind, the oldest daughter of the
        well-respected merchant family, the Sternwinds. The party gets into some trouble sneaking into Sternwind
        Textiles where Agnes and Erich are talking about her upcoming marriage. They are caught by the Sternwinds and
        have guards sent after them. Now on the run, the party sneaks into the Olaran Conclave. For an unknown reason,
        Branch's hand burns a brand on the wooden door to the ampitheater. In the ampitheater, they find a secret spiral
        staircase down into a large underground lake. At the center sits a small island with a granite pedestal at the
        center. At the center of the granite pedestal is a pool of water, that condenses into a glowing blue gem at
        Branch's touch. As they explore the island, a water beast erupts from the lake, attacking the party and killing
        Branch. As Branch dies, she dissolves into dirt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trying to escape from the conclave, they get caught by guard and are being led to the prisons, but Shimyra and
        Khairo are able to get away using misty step and invisibility respectively. Mark casts silent illusion to help
        them get away, and gets taken to prison himself.Shimyra and Khairo find an inn to regroup, Mark gets taken to
        prison and is told he will be speaking with the Grand Cleric. Mark's guard D'artagnan realizes Mark is a magic
        user and talks to him about magic, due to his fascination with magic since his sister is a wizard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mark is taken to a meeting with the Grand Cleric, while Khairo and Shymira sneak back into the conclave to try
        and break him out of prison. Instead, the three of them are confronted by the Grand Cleric Delseris Patia, who
        actually wants to speak to them about the gem the found. She tells them the stone is an elemental gem of Olar,
        used to signify significant times of change across Esrularia. Having found the gem, Patia believes the party to
        be central to this change. She brings them to the conclave library in order to find information to aid them on
        their quest. However, before they can fully investigate, an assassin comes out of the shadows and kills Patia.
        The party interogates the assassin and discover he likely hired by some wealthy family in the city. Mark feels
        bad for the boy, knocks him out instead of killing him, and the party runs off before they can get caught. Wohn
        finds a book titled “History of the Egressian Order” before they leave. Khairo takes the assassin's robes to
        disguise himself as the assassin.
      </p>
      <p>The party runs off to find 4533 Jester, leading them to the most wealthy area of Hightown and fancy manor.
        Shimyra and Mark climb up a tree to check out the second floor window with a single candle light, spotting a
        well dressed middle aged man sitting in a study, clearly waiting for something.
